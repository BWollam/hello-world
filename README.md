<p>In education, as is the case in most industries today, teachers and students constantly use technology to improve learning outcomes.  Throughout 2018 I will continue to develop my expertise in front-end web development and CRM software to be able to deploy high-quality software and business solutions to both non-profit and for-profit institutions. 

The most important thing I look for in a job is how I can add value to others' lives. During my four years serving students I have gained valuable experience managing people and data. I want to continue engaging in meaningful work that adds value to my company and community.

My extensive study abroad and leadership experience and has increased my problem solving and teamwork abilities in challenging environments, as well as contributing to my fluent Spanish and conversational Chinese language skills. I am motivated to work in jobs that involve education, languages, or designing any product that has a positive impact on peoples' experiences. I aspire to engage in a tech career that matches these interests of mine.</p>
